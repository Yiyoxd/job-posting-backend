      "title": "Lead Software Engineer I(Frontend), CEA - Application Monitoring ThousandEyes",
      "description": "Who We Are\n\nThe name ThousandEyes was born from two big ideas: the power to see what’s not ordinarily possible, and the ability to collect intelligence from vantage points as diverse and global as the Internet. As organizations depend on cloud services, the Internet has become their defacto network connecting cloud applications to users. Our Internet and cloud intelligence platform is like a ‘Google maps of the Internet’, providing the only collectively powered view of digital experiences end-to-end. We enable our customers made up of the world’s largest and fastest-growing brands, to identify problems before they impact revenue, brand reputation, or employee productivity.\n\nIn August 2020, Cisco Systems completed the acquisition of ThousandEyes, which now forms the ThousandEyes Business Unit within Cisco’s Network Services Business Group, and is a foundational component of Cisco’s growing Observability business.\n\nWhat You’ll Do\n\nThe goal of the Cloud and Enterprise Agent team is to provide a real-time network monitoring platform that measures, correlates, and visualizes synthetic data about global network conditions. This data allows our customers to gather performance metrics about network services and servers that they depend on and make informed decisions about how to take action should something go wrong. As a Lead Software Engineer on this team, you will be leading the effort to address our two main challenges: keeping up with the ever-increasing amount of data gathered by our agents, and making this information more actionable for our customers.\n\nWe are part of Cloud and Enterprise Agents - Application Platform (CEA-AP), responsible for the visual presentation of our aggregate metrics actively participating in path visualization, metric representation for various different tests, and visual enrichment details. An example of a project we have recently worked on is Multi-metric views. This exciting initiative is to migrate the frontend component of CEA views from a monolithic application to a new micro-frontend with added functionality to reduce the time for root cause analysis. We use a modern tech stack with Typescript + Vue 3 + Pinia + Vitest + Cypress and need support with porting finishing the work. This involved actively partnering with product and design to define behavior, and coordinating across several teams to align effort and rollout.\n\nMinimum Qualifications\n\n Expert understanding of JavaScript and TypeScript  Recent hands-on experience with Vue + VueX/Pinia OR React + Redux  Shown successful track record in leading projects and initiatives  Working knowledge of Java and Spring Boot framework  Excited for new areas of growth and helping make an impact on the product \n\n Preferred Qualifications \n\n Familiarity with micro-frontends  Exposure to network protocols  Involvement with a design system  Experience working on Enterprise SaaS applications  Experience with project planning and working with stakeholders and designers \n\nCisco is an Affirmative Action and Equal Opportunity Employer and all qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, gender, sexual orientation, national origin, genetic information, age, disability, veteran status, or any other legally protected basis. Cisco will consider for employment, on a case by case basis, qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.\n\nWhy Cisco\n\n#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.\n\nWe embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do –you can’t put us in a box! But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)\n\nDay to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.\n\nSo, you have colourful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us.\n\nWe recognize that diverse teams make the strongest teams, and we encourage people from all backgrounds to apply.\n\nCompensation Range\n\n Message to applicants applying to work in the U.S.: \n\nWhen available, the salary range posted for this position reflects the projected hiring range for new hire salaries in U.S. locations. For non-sales roles, the hiring ranges reflect base salary and do not include bonuses, equity, or benefits. Hiring ranges for sales positions include base and incentive target, and do not include equity or benefits. Individual pay is determined by the candidate's hiring location and additional factors, including but not limited to skillset, experience, and relevant education, certifications or training. Applicants may not be eligible for the full salary range based on their U.S. hiring location. The recruiter can share more details about compensation for the role in your location during the hiring process.",
