Traditionally Data Scientists do not do this. Per the manager, finding a 100% match of skills will be difficult. The more aligned skills they have, the better.Organizational Structure And Impact:Describe the function your group supports from an LOB perspective:Experienced ML engineer to work on universal forecasting models. Focus on ML forecasting, Python and Hadoop. Experience with Python, ARIMA, FB Prophet, Seasonal Naive, Gluon.Data Science Innovation (DSI) is a very unique application. It is truly ML-driven at its heart and our forecasting models originally looked singularly at cash balance forecasting. That has all changed as we have now incorporated approximately 100 additional financial metrics from our new DSI Metrics Farm. This allows future model executions to become a Universal Forecasting Model instead of being limited to just cash forecasting. It’s a very exciting application, especially since the models have been integrated within a Marketplace concept UI that allows Subscriber/Contributor functionality to make information and processing more personal and with greater extensibility across the enterprise. The application architecture is represented by OpenShift, Linux, Oracle, SQL Server, Hadoop, MongoDB, APIs, and a great deal of Python code.Describe the current initiatives that this resource will be impacting:Working toward implementation of Machine Learning Services.Team Background and Preferred Candidate History:Do you only want candidates with a similar background or would you like to see candidates with a diverse industry background?Diverse industry background, finance background preferred. Manager is more focused on the skillset.Describe the dynamic of your team and where this candidate will fit into the overall environment:This person will work with a variety of titles including application architects, web engineers, data engineers, data scientists, application system managers, system integrators, and Quality Engineers.Will work with various teams, but primarily working with one core team - approx 15 - onshore and offshore resources.Candidate Technical and skills profile:Describe the role and the key responsibilities in order of which they will be doing daily:Machine Learning Engineer that work with Data Scientists in a SDLC environment into production.Interviews:Describe interview process (who will be involved, how many interviews, etc.):1 round - 1 hour minimum, panel style",
