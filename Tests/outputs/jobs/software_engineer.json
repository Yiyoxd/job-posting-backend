      "title": "Senior Software Engineer, Data Engineering - ThousandEyes",
      "description": "Who We Are\n\nThe name ThousandEyes was born from two big ideas: the power to see things not ordinarily possible and the ability to collect insights from a multitude of vantage points. As the world continues its digital transformation and relies more on cloud services and the Internet, the “network,” which is now both public and private, has become a black box our customers cannot see or understand.\n\nOur Internet and cloud intelligence platform delivers the only collectively powered real-time view of the Internet and private networks, cloud, and SaaS platforms, helping enterprises and service providers identify problems before they impact revenue, damage brand reputation, or halt employee productivity.\n\nIn August 2020, Cisco Systems completed the acquisition of ThousandEyes, which now forms the ThousandEyes Business Unit within the Cisco Networking Business Group and is the Network Assurance solution for Cisco across the Cisco Networking Cloud and Cisco Security Cloud.\n\nAbout The Role\n\nWe are looking for a Senior Data Engineer superhero who is passionate about building next generation Analytics infrastructures and products. You will work directly with our data infrastructure, datasets and analytics tools that are used by Product, Engineering, Marketing, Sales, Finance and Customer Success teams every day.\n\nWhat You’ll Do\n\nYou will contribute to the efforts to build an enterprise-wide ML and AI data platform that will be used across Cisco to power network assurance initiatives across the company. In addition you will participate on a variety of exciting projects that range from designing robust and fully automated data pipelines to building ML-based applications for improving company-wide productivity and the ThousandEyes product. You have a passion for designing, implementing and operating stable, scalable and efficient solutions that move and analyze large data volumes quickly. You are also a self-starter who is comfortable with ambiguity, pays close attention to detail and can work in a fast-paced environment.\n\nIn the Data Engineering team we are excited about the impact data can have in our business, product and our customers' experience – we hope you share our enthusiasm!\n\nQualifications\n\n BS/MS with quantitative focus (e.g. Economics, Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics, Statistics) or equivalent practical experience  5+ years of experience in data engineering, software engineering, or other related roles  3+ years experience operating databases (e.g. Redshift, MySQL, MongoDB) and advanced query authoring & tuning  3+ years of dimensional data modeling & schema design in data warehouses  3+ years of experience developing and operating large scale big data technologies (e.g. Apache Spark, Presto, HDFS, Apache Kafka, Apache Druid)  Experience with ETL tooling (e.g. Airflow)  Expertise in Python  Experience designing, implementing and maintaining production grade data pipelines  Knowledge of cloud-based production grade data architectures (e.g. AWS EC2, EMR, Glue, S3, Redshift)  An eye for automation and instrumentation in all data-related aspects  Work experience in an interdisciplinary / cross-functional field \n\n Preferred Qualifications \n\n Working experience in SaaS companies  Strong cross-functional and interpersonal skills with demonstrated ability to communicate technical content to general audiences  Entrepreneurial in nature - able to keep moving initiatives forward in ambiguous situations \n\nCisco values the perspectives and skills that emerge from employees with diverse backgrounds. That's why Cisco is expanding the boundaries of discovering top talent by not only focusing on candidates with educational degrees and experience but also placing more emphasis on unlocking potential. We believe that everyone has something to offer and that diverse teams are better equipped to solve problems, innovate, and create a positive impact.\n\nWe encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification . Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification. Research shows that people from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy. We urge you not to prematurely exclude yourself and to apply if you're interested in this work.\n\nCisco is an Affirmative Action and Equal Opportunity Employer and all qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, gender, sexual orientation, national origin, genetic information, age, disability, veteran status, or any other legally protected basis. Cisco will consider for employment, on a case by case basis, qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.\n\nUs – Compensation Range – Message To Applicants\n\n150,900 USD - 222,200 USD\n\n Message to applicants applying to work in the U.S.: \n\nWhen available, the salary range posted for this position reflects the projected hiring range for new hire, full-time salaries in U.S. locations, not including equity or benefits. For non-sales roles the hiring ranges reflect base salary only; employees are also eligible to receive annual bonuses. Hiring ranges for sales positions include base and incentive compensation target. Individual pay is determined by the candidate's hiring location and additional factors, including but not limited to skillset, experience, and relevant education, certifications, or training. Applicants may not be eligible for the full salary range based on their U.S. hiring location. The recruiter can share more details about compensation for the role in your location during the hiring process.\n\nU.S. employees have access to quality medical, dental and vision insurance, a 401(k) plan with a Cisco matching contribution, short and long-term disability coverage, basic life insurance and numerous wellbeing offerings. Employees receive up to twelve paid holidays per calendar year, which includes one floating holiday, plus a day off for their birthday. Employees accrue up to 20 days of Paid Time Off (PTO) each year and have access to paid time away to deal with critical or emergency issues without tapping into their PTO. We offer additional paid time to volunteer and give back to the community. Employees are also able to purchase company stock through our Employee Stock Purchase Program.\n\nEmployees on sales plans earn performance-based incentive pay on top of their base salary, which is split between quota and non-quota components. For quota-based incentive pay, Cisco pays at the standard rate of 1% of incentive target for each 1% revenue attainment against the quota up to 100%. Once performance exceeds 100% quota attainment, incentive rates may increase up to five times the standard rate with no cap on incentive compensation. For non-quota-based sales performance elements such as strategic sales objectives, Cisco may pay up to 125% of target. Cisco sales plans do not have a minimum threshold of performance for sales incentive compensation to be paid.",
